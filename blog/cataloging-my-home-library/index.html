About 3 weeks ago I embarked on an adventure to catalog my home library so I could keep a better track of what I actually had and was loaning.
I had previously been organising this by having a shelf in Goodreads which worked to an extent but it felt like more of a stopgap rather than a sustainable solution long term. 
<br>
<br> 
The main improvements I wanted to see in this solution were:
<br>
1. Ease of inputting new books
<br>
2. Intuitive searching within the catalog
<br>
3. Being able to add books without ISBNs
<br>
<br>
Luckily for me I was about to see a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/r8v_9Wk4fqs?si=TvjeAJ356lhxuFE8"> YouTube video </a> that would solve all my issues and spark me to finally make the switch.
Fortunately my collection was nowhere near as large as his 1800 books, but seeing him use a barcode scanner to add books immediately made me realise that adding all of mine would be far less of a pain than I had previously thought.
My luck had not stopped however, because for no discernable reason I actually already had a barcode scanner in my drawer, so it was off to the races. 
<br>
The first step was to take them all off the shelf, which proved trickier than I could have imagined, as I'd stacked them like a jenga tower, but once they were on the bed I started scanning away like there was no tomorrow!
During that I also decided to put them back in a more logical order, to make finding them easier online and in person. I considered alphabetical by surname, which I used throughout childhood, but I was an adult now so I made the choice to sort them by genre instead.
At last I had scanned all the books I could, and had about 95, however there were still a few that I had issues with, mostly papers and textbooks without ISBNs. These required more work to note down important information so that I could add them manually to the catalog, which libib actually let me do (unlike Goodreads who makes you pass a test to add a book) so with that I had all the books in my library.
<br>
<br>
The final count ended up being exactly 100, which was a lot larger than I had thought, and you can see what they are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.libib.com/u/cesw/l/2121308"> here </a>
