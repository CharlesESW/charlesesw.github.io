                <p> Many of my friends seem to have taken up these questions, and never one to be left out I felt it was right that I do the same. Primarily I will credit Abi as she was the first to do it, and therefore the best. You can see that <a href="https://akpain.net/blog/ten-pointless-facts/">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Do you floss your teeth?</h3>
                <p>Sometimes yeah, but definetly not often enough. I need to use those little brushes and they are inconvenient</p>
                <h3>Tea, coffee, or water?</h3>
                <p>What do I drink the most? Water absolutely, I keep a litre cup of it by my bed so I can drink away whenever I please. But for what I like the most, then tea, but not all teas there are so many so its an unfair question.</p>
                <h3>Footwear preference?</h3>
                <p>I believe that I prefer to have footwear as being barefoot too much hurts me. As for what that footwear is, currently I almost always wear my <a href="https://www.deichmann.com/en-gb/p/nike-court-vision-low-trainer-dark-blue-87639">Nike Court Vision Low</a> trainers in blue. I used to have them in red and black, but those have broken apart with time, and having the exact same shoe in a different colour was the best replacement choice</p>
                <h3>Favourite dessert?</h3>
                <p>My favourite dessert has to be a chocolate brownie, it tastes good, its easy to make and you can eat a lot of them without feeling sick. Sadly even with how easy they are to make, you can never get enough and therefore the most honest answer is that my favourite dessert is whichever one is in front of me</p>
                <h3>The first thing you do when you wake up?</h3>
                <p>This really depends on the day, if I need to go to the gym I cry a little about how early it is and then realise i'm already running late. Most other days I sit up and watch reels for a few minutes to ensure that I never stop brainrotting</p>
                <h3>Age you'd like to stick at?</h3>
                <p>Now that I am at the ripe old age of 21, I'm feeling pretty good about it so maybe let's say 21 for now. This might change when I try another age but for now life is looking up so why not hope that remains true</p>
                <h3>How many hats do you own?</h3>
                <p>If I was to take a guess I think I own 5 hats: 2 caps, 2 beanies and 1 cowboy hat. If you take a very liberal view of what counts as a hat I guess you can also include my wig. </p>
                <h3>Describe the last photo you took?</h3>
                <p>When I started this the last photo I took was a screenshot of the available appointments at the GP, either a single option today or wait 4 more weeks. But since I started I walked past a poster that I wanted to take a photo of because it was funny. It was for some sort of Computer Science project that aimed to fix book clubs using AI because they were becoming outdated. Those of you who know me best will know I love books and don't love AI, so this was hurtful to me to think you can use AI to solve studying books. If you wish to laugh at this poster go to the CS atrium or ask me for it, i might have deleted it soon I don't keep things around for long when they annoy me</p>
                <h3>Worst TV show?</h3>
                <p>I would have to say the worst TV show is 'Buying London' which is a reality tv series about estate agents sellling multi-million pound homes around london, but everyone is so unlikeable and the houses are all so outlandishly expensive that it made me feel sick to see. I wouldn't recommend you watch it</p>
                <h3>As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?</h3>
                <p>As I child I had no aspirations</p>
