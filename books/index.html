My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6810480309">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Anyone who's even glanced at my read books will know that I don't read non-fiction, in fact I dare say this might be one of only two that I recall. But when its time to leave your comfort zone it's good to do it with a bang. This book definitely achieved that and more.<br /><br />I will start by mentioning I 'read' this as an audiobook, for I had heard it was the best medium for an autobiography and I can see why people say that, having Fox tell the stories in her own voice adds a lot of weight to the story, making you really appreciate that everything you hear did actually happen to her. <br /><br />I'll admit I knew very little about Julia Fox's life before this, just she was famous in the New York scene and referenced in the hit album BRAT. I think knowing so little played to the book's benefit, as every twist and turn of her life came as a shock, and golly were there are a lot of shocks. I never knew quite how much she had done in her life, from work as a dominatrix to an acting career, it's really all there.<br /><br />I don't really know what I can say, normally i'd talk about the plot and characters in these reviews but I don't think that's how it works for autobiographies, can't really review real life people, or maybe you can idk?<br /><br />What's important is it was a fascinating read and I believe I made a great choice for my first autobiography. Jennette McCurdy's one is coming next I believe, whenever I get around to that.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5197797228">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I will admit I read this almost a year ago so my memory of the text might not be the best but better late than never. <br /><br />I will start by saying I loved <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion__Hyperion_Cantos___1_" title="Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, #1) by Dan Simmons" rel="nofollow noopener">Hyperion</a>, it was a truly brilliant book, very cleverly in the format of the Canterbury Tales, with the pilgrims taking turns telling their story, and importantly the book ending before they arrive. This made sense because its about the journey not the destination, which I loved. So then when I saw there was a sequel I was confused, in my mind it did not need one because the story was complete. <br /><br />Assuming you've already seen that I've given this 4 stars, it is clear that I changed my mind while reading the book. I think it succeeding in convincing me that it should exist by being so different to the first. Simmons did not shy away from changing the formula, gone was the recounting the past, it was all go go go in the future. It was also nice to get the outer world fleshed out a lot more, what it takes to choose to send 7 people into what is thought to be eternal torture in the hopes of preventing disaster, and what that does for the greater society is a fascinating concept. Unsurprisingly the character work remained incredible, benefited by the plentiful background we had from the previous book. <br /><br />All together this is a great book and a worthy sequel to Hyperion, now its time to see if the next few in the series can continue to hold up as well.
