My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7541801633">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I really wanted to like this book, as I did enjoy Vonnegut's other books I've read, especially <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five" title="Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut Jr." rel="nofollow noopener">Slaughterhouse-Five</a>. It was unfortunately more like the first of his books I read, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4980.Breakfast_of_Champions" title="Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut Jr." rel="nofollow noopener">Breakfast of Champions</a>, in the sense that I didn't have a clue what was going on in the whole thing. That does seem to be his style and there's nothing wrong with an interesting style, but I didn't understand what it was all meant to mean. Slaughterhouse Five was weird and wacky and hard to follow but it was also very clearly a novel that had something to say about war and its impact on life. Why did it succeed more than the other two? well that answer to me is simple, the book is a semi-autobiography, Kurt himself was within the real slaughterhouse five when he was young and in the war. But this isn't a review of slaughterhouse five, which I do still need to write so I apologise to my fans. <br /><br />If we put aside slaughterhouse five, the real question then is what made this worse to me than Breakfast of Champions? I would have to say the structure, breakfast pulled me right in by giving me the end but sirens did not. And obviously maybe doing the exact same starting technique in two novels isn't a great idea, but it would have worked so well. Essentially the only driving force of the novel is Rumfoord (and the Tralfamadorians by proxy) who's entire thing is that he is scattered through space and time and knows the future, which lends itself quite well to that sort of narrative structure. In fairness he does 'predict' the general plot of the story at the beginning but that didn't really bring much joy. <br /><br />Onto the plot then, it just didn't interest me, it felt as though it was three vaguely related plots that jumped so randomly one onto the next that it didn't lend itself to an enjoyable flow. I think what really held it back was as previously said Rumfoord steers everything that happens and frankly I never actually knew why he did anything and it's very hard to get stuck into a plot that seems to be happening because it was always going to happen and he's just pushing the cart down a pre-determined road with no enjoyment. In many places he is shown to not be enjoying what he is doing, as though everything that was happening was not his own doing. And at a shallow level I can understand its meant to be a criticism of organised religion, which I think he directly says somewhere in the novel but I can't quite remember because it took so long to read. But I think a critique has to be a critique textually rather than just nominally and it failed at that. <br /><br />Characters:<br />There certainly were characters, none of them really got me invested and much like my criticism of the plot they all felt like they were doing things because the novel required them to do that not for any logical reason. Half of the main characters forget who they are and are mind controlled for a third of the novel, quite literally making them quite literally do whatever is required of them. <br />It was only in the epilogue when we could sit with the characters for any period of time that I felt even a hint of connection to them, and even that was fleeting.<br /><br />In the end this review has become more negative than I had hoped for but if you liked Vonnegut's other works I do think its worth at least trying to read, but Slaughterhouse Five was better and I really do need to write a positive review for it :)

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6810480309">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Anyone who's even glanced at my read books will know that I don't read non-fiction, in fact I dare say this might be one of only two that I recall. But when its time to leave your comfort zone it's good to do it with a bang. This book definitely achieved that and more.<br /><br />I will start by mentioning I 'read' this as an audiobook, for I had heard it was the best medium for an autobiography and I can see why people say that, having Fox tell the stories in her own voice adds a lot of weight to the story, making you really appreciate that everything you hear did actually happen to her. <br /><br />I'll admit I knew very little about Julia Fox's life before this, just she was famous in the New York scene and referenced in the hit album BRAT. I think knowing so little played to the book's benefit, as every twist and turn of her life came as a shock, and golly were there are a lot of shocks. I never knew quite how much she had done in her life, from work as a dominatrix to an acting career, it's really all there.<br /><br />I don't really know what I can say, normally i'd talk about the plot and characters in these reviews but I don't think that's how it works for autobiographies, can't really review real life people, or maybe you can idk?<br /><br />What's important is it was a fascinating read and I believe I made a great choice for my first autobiography. Jennette McCurdy's one is coming next I believe, whenever I get around to that.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5197797228">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I will admit I read this almost a year ago so my memory of the text might not be the best but better late than never. <br /><br />I will start by saying I loved <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion__Hyperion_Cantos___1_" title="Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, #1) by Dan Simmons" rel="nofollow noopener">Hyperion</a>, it was a truly brilliant book, very cleverly in the format of the Canterbury Tales, with the pilgrims taking turns telling their story, and importantly the book ending before they arrive. This made sense because its about the journey not the destination, which I loved. So then when I saw there was a sequel I was confused, in my mind it did not need one because the story was complete. <br /><br />Assuming you've already seen that I've given this 4 stars, it is clear that I changed my mind while reading the book. I think it succeeding in convincing me that it should exist by being so different to the first. Simmons did not shy away from changing the formula, gone was the recounting the past, it was all go go go in the future. It was also nice to get the outer world fleshed out a lot more, what it takes to choose to send 7 people into what is thought to be eternal torture in the hopes of preventing disaster, and what that does for the greater society is a fascinating concept. Unsurprisingly the character work remained incredible, benefited by the plentiful background we had from the previous book. <br /><br />All together this is a great book and a worthy sequel to Hyperion, now its time to see if the next few in the series can continue to hold up as well.
