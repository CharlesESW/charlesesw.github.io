My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5197797228">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I will admit I read this almost a year ago so my memory of the text might not be the best but better late than never. <br /><br />I will start by saying I loved <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion__Hyperion_Cantos___1_" title="Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, #1) by Dan Simmons" rel="nofollow noopener">Hyperion</a>, it was a truly brilliant book, very cleverly in the format of the Canterbury Tales, with the pilgrims taking turns telling their story, and importantly the book ending before they arrive. This made sense because its about the journey not the destination, which I loved. So then when I saw there was a sequel I was confused, in my mind it did not need one because the story was complete. <br /><br />Assuming you've already seen that I've given this 4 stars, it is clear that I changed my mind while reading the book. I think it succeeding in convincing me that it should exist by being so different to the first. Simmons did not shy away from changing the formula, gone was the recounting the past, it was all go go go in the future. It was also nice to get the outer world fleshed out a lot more, what it takes to choose to send 7 people into what is thought to be eternal torture in the hopes of preventing disaster, and what that does for the greater society is a fascinating concept. Unsurprisingly the character work remained incredible, benefited by the plentiful background we had from the previous book. <br /><br />All together this is a great book and a worthy sequel to Hyperion, now its time to see if the next few in the series can continue to hold up as well.
